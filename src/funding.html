        <p class="mb-4">
          For over 30 years, DFI has helped provide funding for research
          being carried out by Dr. Robert H. Brown, previously at the Day
          Neuromuscular Research Laboratory at Massachusetts General
          Hospital (MGH), and currently at UMASS Medical Center in
          collaboration with Dr. Florian Eichler at MGH.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-deater-blue mt-8 mb-4">What has the funding accomplished?</h3>

        <ul class="space-y-4 mb-6">
          <li>
            Due in part to research funded by the Deater Foundation for more than 20
            years, the gene causing HSAN1 (SPTLC1) has been identified and a
            mechanism has been theorized.
          </li>

          <li>
            Funding has also helped finance work on HSAN1 mouse models to provide key
            insights which, coupled with similar findings made in humans, have been
            extremely useful in theorizing the mechanism of the disease.
          </li>

          <li>
            In both 2008 and 2010, 2013, and 2017, DFI provided MGH with funds to host
            an HSAN1 Symposium where top researchers from around the world met
            together to discuss HSAN1 and their research as it pertained to the disease.
            These scientists represented areas such as: neurobiology, neuromuscular
            diseases, biochemistry, and clinical chemistry. Throughout each of the
            symposiums, these scientists shared and discussed their research openly with
            each other in an effort to collectively make advancements in understanding
            HSAN1.
          </li>

          <li>
            In 2011, DFI provided Dr. Brown and Dr. Eichler with seed money to start the
            first ever human study for patients with HSAN1. This pilot study builds on
            successful experiments with mice raised with the HSAN1 disease gene that
            were given an amino acid treatment. This treatment brought about promising
            results in mice, therefore the human pilot study is the next step in evaluating
            the efficacy of the treatment. The pilot study will involve a small group (5-6) of
            HSAN1 patients who will be given a high dosage of the treatment for one year.
            Results will be measured against individual baseline measurements to
            determine treatment efficacy.
