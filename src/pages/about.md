      <p>The Deater Foundation emerged from one family’s story of perseverance. When medical expenses and lost wages nearly unraveled their lives, the community stepped in with generosity and practical aid. That experience inspired the Deater family to create a foundation that would replicate the same compassion for others.</p>
      <p>Today we invest in rapid response funding, family coaching, and collaborative partnerships that ensure families have the resources they need during moments of crisis. Our approach centers dignity, choice, and culturally responsive care.</p>
      <h2>Guiding principles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Families first:</strong> We listen before we act, ensuring families shape every decision.</li>
        <li><strong>Trust-based philanthropy:</strong> We reduce red tape so help arrives quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> We convene partners who bring expertise far beyond our walls.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The foundation is governed by a volunteer board representing lived experience, philanthropy, law, education, and healthcare. Together they oversee strategy, financial stewardship, and accountability.</p>
