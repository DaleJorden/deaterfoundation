                Dr. Brown is director of the Program in Neurofibromatosis and
                director of the Day Neuromuscular Laboratory. He has made leading
                discoveries related to various forms of motor neuron disease,
                including the biology of SOX10, which is also associated with HSAN1.
                He has served as National Coordinator for ALS clinical trials, and was a
                key figure when the gene causing HSAN1 was discovered.

                Dr. Eichler focuses on neurogenetics, particularly the study of leukodystrophies
                and peripheral neuropathies. His research laboratory explores sphingolipid metabolism
                and its neurological implications. He has been instrumental in conducting clinical trials
                for HSAN1, including the L-serine treatment studies.
