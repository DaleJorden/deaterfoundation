          <strong>Mission Statement:</strong> To promote awareness and raise funding to support
          research on HSAN1, a hereditary sensory neuropathy, with the hopes of
          finding a potential treatment and cure for this disease.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          Deater Foundation Inc. (DFI) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that was
          founded in May of 1990 in an effort to raise finances to fund research on
          HSAN1. The name comes from the fact that this foundation was started by
          members of the Deater family, a very large family in which many members
          are affected by HSAN1.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          The initial hope behind creating DFI was that funding of research to study this
          disease would expedite the discovery of gene linkage which, in turn, would
          make possible new medical avenues such as genetic counseling, gene
          therapy, and/or treatment of the disease. More than 20 years later, a few of
          these goals have been realized, thanks in part to funding provided by DFI,
          and DFI continues to support research toward a treatment and cure for this
          debilitating disease.
