      <p>Our coaches meet families where they are—often in their homes or preferred community spaces. We listen first, map strengths, and then identify practical next steps that align with the family’s vision.</p>
      <p>Sessions cover budgeting, tenant rights, school advocacy, and access to mental health resources. We also connect caregivers to peer mentors who have navigated similar journeys.</p>
      <p>Families typically work with a coach for 6–12 months, celebrating milestones along the way and graduating with a personalized resilience playbook.</p>
