      <p>Through Community Wellness Collaboratives, we transform underutilized community spaces into vibrant hubs. Families can meet with legal aid, receive preventative health screenings, and access tutoring in a single visit.</p>
      <p>Local businesses provide volunteers and in-kind resources, while our staff coordinates schedules, data sharing, and evaluation. The result is a holistic safety net that reduces duplication and strengthens trust.</p>
      <p>We currently operate collaboratives in three counties with plans to expand to two additional regions next year.</p>
