      <p>The Harrisburg Area School District and eleven regional schools have formalized referral agreements with the Deater Foundation. School social workers can now submit real-time assistance requests through our secure partner portal.</p>
      <p>This partnership means families receive coordinated financial support, food security resources, and coaching without having to repeat their story multiple times.</p>
      <p>Over the next quarter we anticipate a 30% increase in student-centered referrals and have expanded our advocate team to maintain rapid response times.</p>
