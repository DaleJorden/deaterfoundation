      <p>Through our Volunteer Care Network we distributed 5,000 meals and 850 care kits between January and March. The initiative is powered by corporate partners and local congregations who organize monthly packing events.</p>
      <p>Families receiving emergency grants often experience food insecurity while stabilizing their budgets. Meal deliveries and care kits provide immediate relief and demonstrate that the community is walking alongside them.</p>
